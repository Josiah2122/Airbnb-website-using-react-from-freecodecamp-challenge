In order for this to work you should put the images folder inside the public folder
And put the rest in the src folder
- I am also using index.js instead of App.js which is the default when you create your react

Description: 
  - It is almost dynamic beacuse it is getting the cards from the data.js file which is in the components folder
  - you can add more data in the data.js file and it will add them next to the cards, just remember to add the image in publc images folder
  - when you are inputing data in the data.js file only write the name of the image and the type as the rest, use the previous for example
